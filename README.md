# Airbnb Clone Project

Welcome to my Airbnb Clone project ðŸš€. This is a full-stack web application inspired by Airbnb, where users can browse property listings, see detailed information for each property, and complete bookings. The app covers the entire workflow, from frontend development to backend APIs, database design, and deployment.

## Project Goals
The main goals of this project are to:
- Build a working booking system where users can search for properties, view details, and make reservations
- Learn how to implement responsive UI/UX designs that work across all devices
- Understand how to structure a full-stack web application from frontend to backend
- Practice component-based frontend architecture using React
- Follow best practices for clean code, documentation, testing, and project organization

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
- **Design Tools:** Figma (for UI/UX design)

## UI/UX Design Planning

Designing the user experience is a huge part of making this Airbnb Clone feel real and easy to use. The goal is to make sure users can find properties, check details, and book smoothly without getting confused or lost.

### Design Goals
- Create an intuitive booking flow thatâ€™s easy to follow
- Maintain visual consistency across the site

## UI Component Patterns

To keep the design consistent and reusable across the app, the following UI components are planned:

### Navbar
- **Logo:** Displays the app logo and links to the home page  
- **Search bar:** Allows users to search for properties  
- **User navigation:** Profile, login/logout, and user menu  
- **Responsive menu:** Adapts for mobile and tablet screens  

### Property Card
- **Property image:** Shows the main image of the property  
- **Basic details:** Includes price, location, and rating  
- **Favorite button:** Lets users save properties  
- **Responsive layout:** Works on all screen sizes  

### Footer
- **Site links:** Quick access to main pages  
- **Company information:** About, contact, terms  
- **Social media links:** Connect with social platforms  
- **Copyright information:** Displays ownership and legal info  

These components are designed for reusability, so they can be used across multiple pages without repeating code, keeping the interface clean and consistent.
